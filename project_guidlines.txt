[X]- Your project must be implemented in Python.
- Your project must have a main function and three or more additional functions. At least three of those additional functions must be accompanied by tests that can be executed with pytest.
    - Your main function must be in a file called project.py, which should be in the “root” (i.e., top-level folder) of your project.
    - Your 3 required custom functions other than main must also be in project.py and defined at the same indentation level as main (i.e., not nested under any classes or functions).
    - Your test functions must be in a file called test_project.py, which should also be in the “root” of your project. Be sure they have the same name as your custom functions, prepended with test_ (test_custom_function, for example, where custom_function is a function you’ve implemented in project.py).
    - You are welcome to implement additional classes and functions as you see fit beyond the minimum requirement.
- Implementing your project should entail more time and effort than is required by each of the course’s problem sets.
- Any pip-installable libraries that your project requires must be listed, one per line, in a file called requirements.txt in the root of your project.
- Create a README.md
- Create a video explaining the project

PMO:
- Consider making goal milestones to keep you on trak

Getting started:
What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
    - 

What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?
    - My goal is to implement all lessons learned in some way. Certain ideals might be superseeded by other concepts, but I want to bring a good variety to strengthen the application
    of certain skills


If working with one or two classmates, who will do what?
    - I won't
In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect.
And so it’s not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.
What might you consider to be a good outcome for your project? A better outcome? The best outcome
